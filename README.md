**State the problem/issue to resolve**: Many people struggle with meal planning. Recipe Genius will provide a variety of delicious recipes based on the available ingredients. 

**Previous works & References**: https://www.supercook.com/#/desktop

**Assumptions / operating environments / intended usage**: Generating recipe based on the available ingredients 


**Plan and approach to the solution**:  
1. Our team will look for public APIs that can support our project requirements
2. During our projects, we will learn from other resources that are similar to our project. We will update the reference list throughout the time.
3. We will catch the user input (ingredients) with the Scanner class
4. We might either write our own method or use available ones to match the input with the database 
6. We will list the dishes that have the most matches
7. Users can see the detailed instructions once they choose the recipe.
8. If users are unsatisfied, they can choose another recipe. 


**How our solution tackles the issues**: 
Users do not need to come up with recipes and instructions by themselves. They will no longer need to brainstorm and spend a long time searching for the right recipe on the internet. Instead, they can use Recipe Genius, which will help them save time and energy by generating delicious recipes with detailed instructions. Recipes are also diverse, from Asian to Western food, from sweet to spicy. 

**List of operations for each intended user (in list format)**:
- Users input any ingredients that they have at home (e.g. carrot, potato, garlic, etc.)
- Recipe Genius generate a list of recipe that can be created with the available ingredients
- Users then choose the recipe they prefer
- Recipe Genius shows the detailed cooking instructions
