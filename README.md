<b>Proposal Contributions</b>
<li>
  All three team members demonstrated exceptional collaboration and equal participation in the proposal phase of the Recipe Genius project. Everyone jointly engaged in idea conceptualization, harnessing their diverse perspectives to refine the project's vision and objectives. Each member contributed significantly to the research process, collectively analyzing market trends, potential user needs, and existing competitive solutions. This collaborative effort ensured a well-rounded and thorough understanding of the project's context. In drafting the proposal, they equally divided responsibilities, ensuring that each voice and viewpoint was represented. Everyone’s combined efforts in writing and revising the proposal resulted in a comprehensive and cohesive plan that laid a strong foundation for the project's subsequent phases.

<b>Presentation Contributions</b>
<li>
 <b>Kaung Sithu Hein(Erik)</b> :
In our Recipe Generator project, Erik played a role in elucidating the intricacies of our codebase. Erik provided clear and engaging explanations of how different components of the project were developed and integrated, making the complex architecture of our application understandable and relatable to both team members and other students in the class. Erik skill was particularly noticeable in breaking down the organization of files and classes into easily digestible segments, thereby conveying a logical and efficient structure of our application to the audience.

 <b>May Sabai</b> :
May played an instrumental role in shaping the visual and design aspects. Her keen eye for aesthetics, coupled with her proficiency in design software, significantly enhanced the project's visual appeal and user experience. May skillfully utilized Figma to create detailed layouts and designs for our application's interface.The structured framework May developed in Figma was particularly valuable during the planning and design stages, guiding us in translating our ideas into tangible features. May's contributions were crucial in developing a polished and innovative "Recipe Genius" application, accurately reflecting its intended functionality and user-centric design.

 <b>Hardik Gauba</b> :
In shaping the architecture of our Recipe Generator project, Hardik was pivotal in integrating and elucidating key object-oriented design patterns. Their deep understanding of Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation was evident as they skillfully demonstrated our application in our project’s code structure. Hardik also helped explain how Inheritance allowed for code reusability and extension, how Polymorphism enabled the flexibility of our design, and how Encapsulation helped in safeguarding data integrity and simplifying complexity. Their ability to clearly articulate these abstract concepts and their practical applications played a vital role in both optimizing our code and enhancing the team's understanding of effective object-oriented programming practices.
