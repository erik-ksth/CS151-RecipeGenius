**State the problem/issue to resolve**: Many people struggle with meal planning. Recipe Genius will provide a variety of delicious recipes based on the available ingredients. 

**Previous works & References**: 

**Assumptions / operating environments / intended usage**: Generating recipe based on the available ingredients 


**Plan and approach to the solution**:  Creating a recipe generator as a computer science project is a complex and multifaceted task. Here's a high-level plan and approach to get you started on this project:

Project Scope and Requirements Gathering:
Clearly define the scope of your project. What are the key features and functionalities you want to include in your recipe generator?
Gather requirements by conducting user surveys or interviews to understand what potential users expect from such a tool.
Data Collection and Database:
Collect a large dataset of recipes. You can use public APIs, scrape recipe websites, or create your own database by manually inputting recipes.
Organize the data into a structured database, including details like ingredients, cooking instructions, preparation time, dietary labels, and more.
Algorithm Development:
Design algorithms for generating recipes. This may involve machine learning techniques, rule-based systems, or a combination of both.
Implement algorithms that can suggest recipes based on user inputs, such as preferred cuisine, dietary restrictions, available ingredients, and cooking skill level.
User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design:
Create an intuitive and user-friendly UI for your recipe generator application. Consider web or mobile app development, depending on your target platform.
Focus on a responsive design that works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Design features like search, filter, and save favorite recipes.
User Input and Preferences:
Implement input forms for users to specify their preferences, including dietary restrictions, allergies, cuisine choices, and available ingredients.
Allow users to save their preferences for future use.
Recipe Generation:
Utilize the data and algorithms to generate recipe recommendations based on user inputs.
Ensure that the generated recipes match the user's criteria and provide clear instructions.
Nutritional Information:
Implement a feature to display nutritional information for each recipe, including calorie counts, macronutrients, and dietary labels.
Personalization and Customization:
Enable personalization by allowing users to rate recipes and provide feedback.
Use this feedback to refine recipe recommendations for each user over time.
Testing and Quality Assurance:
Thoroughly test the application to identify and fix any bugs, usability issues, or performance problems.
Conduct usability testing with potential users to gather feedback.
Deployment and Hosting:
Host your application on a server or cloud platform.
Ensure that the application can handle multiple users and traffic loads.
Documentation:
Create user documentation and help guides to assist users in using the recipe generator effectively.
Document the codebase for future reference.
User Feedback and Iteration:
Launch the recipe generator to a limited audience or in a beta phase to gather real-world feedback.
Use user feedback to make improvements and add new features.
Scaling and Maintenance:
As the user base grows, be prepared to scale your infrastructure to handle increased traffic.
Continuously maintain and update the application, including adding new recipes and features.
Marketing and Promotion:
Promote your recipe generator through various channels to attract users. Consider social media, food blogs, and collaboration with influencers.
Monetization (Optional):
If desired, explore monetization options such as ads, premium features, or subscription models.
Legal and Ethical Considerations:
Ensure that you have the necessary rights to use the recipes and data you include.
Address any legal and ethical concerns related to user data and privacy.
This project will likely require skills in programming, database management, web or mobile app development, and potentially machine learning or natural language processing, depending on the complexity of your recommendation algorithms. Be prepared for a dynamic and iterative development process as you refine and improve your recipe generator based on user feedback and evolving requirements.


**How our solution tackles the issues**: 
Users do not need to come up with recipes and instructions by themselves. They will no longer need to brainstorm and spend a long time searching for the right recipe on the internet. Instead, they can use Recipe Genius, which will help them save time and energy by generating delicious recipes with detailed instructions. Recipes are also diverse, from Asian to Western food, from sweet to spicy. 

**List of operations for each intended user (in list format)**:
- Users input any ingredients that they have at home (e.g. carrot, potato, garlic, etc.)
- Recipe Genius generate a list of recipe that can be created with the available ingredients
- Users then choose the recipe they prefer
- Recipe Genius shows the detailed cooking instructions
